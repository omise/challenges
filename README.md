**Tamboon React** is a code challenge for frontend developer.

## Scenario
Once upon a time.. nope!  
So here, you have been temporarily hired by Omise and assigned to work on the charity donation project which the previously assigned front-end developer and designer got the urgent matters to solve, so they will not be able to finish the project on time..

Fortunately, the API server is already done. You will need to grab on the requirements and complete the project while ensuring the application to have great engineering and well-design âœ¨

## Surprise us!
Ready to surprise us what you have done? Email your changes as a git patch to jobs@omise.co.  
Please remember that your patch must consist of multiple separate commits. Your commit message must communicate clearly what has been done in each commit.

If you notice more bugs in the original implementation you can add fixes for those as well. You won't be penalized if you don't. However we ask you not to add more features than the one given in the mission list.

Let's rock! :metal:
